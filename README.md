## ✅ RAG Personal Portfolio Chatbot Setup –Make Your Resume Speak

---

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used so the chatbot can fetch real info from your resume before answering, instead of guessing.

Pinecone stores and retrieves your resume data in vector form, making it fast and scalable to search relevant info for each question.

cd RAG_For_Portfolio
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2️⃣ ✅ Set Up Pinecone

**A. Create Account:**

- Go to [https://app.pinecone.io](https://app.pinecone.io)
- Create a project (choose **Starter (Free)** tier)
- Copy:

  - **API Key**
  - **Environment** (e.g., `gcp-starter`, `us-east-1`)

**B. Create Index:**

- Go to “Indexes” → **Create Index**

  - Name: `nikhil-resume-index`
  - Metric: `cosine`
  - Dimension: `1536` (for OpenAI embeddings)

### 3️⃣ Create a `.env` File

Add your keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-key
INDEX_NAME=nikhil-resume-index
```

---

### 4️⃣ Prepare Resume Data

Replace the exsisting resume and info files with yours. The info.txt file is used to save information that might not be included in your resume like visa status, salary expections etc.

---

### 5️⃣ Populate Pinecone Vectorstore

Run a script `index_resume.py` after updating the file names in the script.

```bash
python3 index_resume.py
```

Once this has run successfully you will see generated indexes on Pinecone console:

### 6️⃣ Run the Flask Backend

```bash
python3 chat_backend.py
```

✅ You should see:

```
Running on http://0.0.0.0:5004
```

---

### 7️⃣ Test the API Locally Using `curl`

Run this command in your terminal to test the chatbot:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5004/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What experience does Nikhil have with AI or ML?"}'
```

✅ If everything’s working, you'll get a JSON response from the backend with an answer based on your resume.

### 8️⃣ Plug Into the Frontend

Use the provided HTML/JS frontend. Update the JS fetch URL:

```js
fetch("https://yourdomain.com/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: userInput }),
});
```

---

### Ask Questions Like:

- “What experience does [name] have with ML?”
- “Which cloud platforms has he worked with?”
- “Has he done CI/CD automation?”

---

## 🏁 You're Done!
